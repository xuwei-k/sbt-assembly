issue reporting guideline
-------------------------

Effective bug reports are more likely to be fixed. These guidelines explain how to write such reports.

## preliminaries

- Make sure your software is up to date.
- Search [github issues][1] to see whether your bug has already been reported.
- Open one case for each problem.
- Proceed to the next steps for details.

## where to file a bug report

- For most of the issues you encounter and enhancement ideas use [github issues][1] to report them.
- If it's a general discussion, try [sbt mailing list][2] and ping me on twitter (@eed3si9n) about it.

You may think it's better to phrase a bug report as a general "question" in case it's not program's bug. Don't worry about it. The developers don't get offended by invalid bug reports.

## how to file a bug report
The developers need three things from you: **steps**, **problem**, and **expectation**.

### steps
First and foremost, the developers need **exact steps to reproduce your problems on his/her computer**. This is called reproduction steps, which is often shortened to "repro steps" or "steps." Describe your method of running it. Provide the build files that was used that caused the problem.

**Repro steps are the most important part of a bug report.** If the developers cannot reproduce the problem in one way or the other, the problem can't be fixed. Telling them the error messages is not enough.

### problem
Next, describe the problem, or what you think is the problem. It might be "obvious" to you that it's a problem, but it could actually be an intentional behavior for some backward compatibility etc. For complication errors, include stack trace. More raw info the better.

### expectation
Same as the problem. Describe what you think should've happened.

### notes
Add an optional notes section to describe your analysis.

### subject
The subject of the bug report doesn't matter. A more descriptive subject is certainly better, but a good subject really depends on the analysis of the problem, so don't worry too much about it.

### formatting
If possible, use github-flavored Markdown. In particular, use ``` to quote code or console outputs as follows:

    ```scala
    import sbt._
    import Keys._
    import sbtassembly.Plugin._
    import AssemblyKeys._

    object Builds extends Build {
      lazy val buildSettings = Defaults.defaultSettings ++ Seq(
        version := "0.1-SNAPSHOT",
        organization := "com.example",
        scalaVersion := "2.10.1"
      )

      lazy val app = Project("app", file("app"),
        settings = buildSettings ++ assemblySettings) settings(
          // your settings here
        )
    }
    ```

The above will be displayed nicely in fixed width font with Scala syntax highlights.

## pull reqs

The ultimate way of reporting a bug is to actually fix it and send us a pull request. The same principle appies here. Document what you changed and why using reproducible cases. Please add scripted tests if possible to demonstrate your case.

By sending the pull request, we assume that you agree to release your work under the license that covers this software.

### .gitignore

Please use [global .gitignore](http://help.github.com/ignore-files/) instead of adding editor junk files to `.gitignore`.
