sbt-assembly
============

*Deploy fat JARs. Restart processes.*

sbt-assembly is a sbt 0.10+ port of an awesome sbt plugin by codahale:

> assembly-sbt is a [simple-build-tool](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/)
plugin for building a single JAR file of your project which includes all of its
dependencies, allowing to deploy the damn thing as a single file without dicking
around with shell scripts and lib directories or, worse, welding your
configuration to your deployable in the form of a WAR file.

Requirements
------------

* sbt
* The burning desire to have a simple deploy procedure.

Setup
-----

### Using Published Plugin

For sbt 0.13 add sbt-assembly as a dependency in `project/assembly.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.10.0")
```

For sbt 0.12, see [sbt-assemlby 0.9.2](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly/tree/0.9.2).

### Using Source Dependency

Alternately, you can have sbt checkout and build the plugin's source from version control.

Specify sbt-assembly.git as a dependency in `project/project/build.scala`:

```scala
import sbt._

object Plugins extends Build {
  lazy val root = Project("root", file(".")) dependsOn(
    uri("git://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly.git#XX") // where XX is tag or sha1
  )
}
```

(You may need to check this project's tags to see what the most recent release
is. I'm notoriously crap about updating the version numbers in my READMEs.)

Usage
-----

### Applying the Plugin to a Project (Adding the `assembly` Task)

First, make sure that you've added the plugin to your build (either the published
builds or source from Git).


If you're using `build.sbt` add this:

```scala
import AssemblyKeys._ // put this at the top of the file

assemblySettings

// your settings here
```

If you are using multi-project `build.sbt`:

```scala
import AssemblyKeys._

lazy val buildSettings = Seq(
  version := "0.1-SNAPSHOT",
  organization := "com.example",
  scalaVersion := "2.10.1"
)

val app = (project in file("app")).
  settings(buildSettings: _*).
  settings(assemblySettings: _*).
  settings(
    // your settings here
  )
```

Now you'll have an awesome new `assembly` task which will compile your project,
run your tests, and then pack your class files and all your dependencies into a
single JAR file: `target/scala_X.X.X/projectname-assembly-X.X.X.jar`.

    > assembly

If you specify a `mainClass in assembly` in build.sbt (or just let it autodetect
one) then you'll end up with a fully executable JAR, ready to rock.

Here is the list of the keys you can rewire for `assembly` task. 

**NOTE**: Any customization must be written after `assemblySettings`.

    jarName                       test                          mainClass
    outputPath                    mergeStrategy                 assemblyOption
    excludedJars                  assembledMappings

For example the name of the jar can be set as follows in build.sbt:

```scala
jarName in assembly := "something.jar"
```

To skip the test during assembly,

```scala
test in assembly := {}
```

To set an explicit main class,

```scala
mainClass in assembly := Some("com.example.Main")
```

### Merge Strategy

If multiple files share the same relative path (e.g. a resource named
`application.conf` in multiple dependency JARs), the default strategy is to
verify that all candidates have the same contents and error out otherwise.
This behavior can be configured on a per-path basis using either one
of the following built-in strategies or writing a custom one:

* `MergeStrategy.deduplicate` is the default described above
* `MergeStrategy.first` picks the first of the matching files in classpath order
* `MergeStrategy.last` picks the last one
* `MergeStrategy.singleOrError` bails out with an error message on conflict
* `MergeStrategy.concat` simply concatenates all matching files and includes the result
* `MergeStrategy.filterDistinctLines` also concatenates, but leaves out duplicates along the way
* `MergeStrategy.rename` renames the files originating from jar files
* `MergeStrategy.discard` simply discards matching files

The mapping of path names to merge strategies is done via the setting
`assembly-merge-strategy` which can be augmented as follows:

```scala
mergeStrategy in assembly <<= (mergeStrategy in assembly) { (old) =>
  {
    case PathList("javax", "servlet", xs @ _*)         => MergeStrategy.first
    case PathList(ps @ _*) if ps.last endsWith ".html" => MergeStrategy.first
    case "application.conf" => MergeStrategy.concat
    case "unwanted.txt"     => MergeStrategy.discard
    case x => old(x)
  }
}
```

**NOTE**:
- `mergeStrategy in assembly` expects a function, you can't do `mergeStrategy in assembly := MergeStrategy.first`!
- Some files must be discarded or renamed otherwise, you're breaking the zip or legal license. Use the pattern above.

By the way, the first case pattern in the above using `PathList(...)` is how you can pick `javax/servlet/*` from the first jar. If the default `MergeStrategy.deduplicate` is not working for you, that likely means you have multiple versions of some library pulled by your dependency graph. The real solution is to fix that dependency graph. You can work around it by `MergeStrategy.first` but don't be surprised when you see `ClassNotFoundException`.

Here is the default:

```scala
  val defaultMergeStrategy: String => MergeStrategy = { 
    case "reference.conf" | "rootdoc.txt" =>
      MergeStrategy.concat
    case PathList(ps @ _*) if isReadme(ps.last) || isLicenseFile(ps.last) =>
      MergeStrategy.rename
    case PathList("META-INF", xs @ _*) =>
      (xs map {_.toLowerCase}) match {
        case ("manifest.mf" :: Nil) | ("index.list" :: Nil) | ("dependencies" :: Nil) =>
          MergeStrategy.discard
        case ps @ (x :: xs) if ps.last.endsWith(".sf") || ps.last.endsWith(".dsa") =>
          MergeStrategy.discard
        case "plexus" :: xs =>
          MergeStrategy.discard
        case "services" :: xs =>
          MergeStrategy.filterDistinctLines
        case ("spring.schemas" :: Nil) | ("spring.handlers" :: Nil) =>
          MergeStrategy.filterDistinctLines
        case _ => MergeStrategy.deduplicate
      }
    case _ => MergeStrategy.deduplicate
  }
```

Custom `MergeStrategy`s can find out where a particular file comes
from using the `sourceOfFileForMerge` method on `sbtassembly.AssemblyUtils`,
which takes the temporary directory and one of the files passed into the
strategy as parameters.

### Excluding jars and files

To exclude some jar file, first consider using `"provided"` dependency. The dependency will be part of compilation and test, but excluded from the runtime. Next, try creating a custom configuration that describes your classpath. If all efforts fail, here's a way to exclude jars:

```scala
excludedJars in assembly <<= (fullClasspath in assembly) map { cp => 
  cp filter {_.data.getName == "compile-0.1.0.jar"}
}
```

To exclude specific files, customize merge strategy:

```scala
mergeStrategy in assembly <<= (mergeStrategy in assembly) { (old) =>
  {
    case PathList("application.conf") => MergeStrategy.discard
    case x => old(x)
  }
}
```

To exclude Scala library,

```scala
assemblyOption in assembly ~= { _.copy(includeScala = false) }
```

To exclude the class files from the main sources,

```scala
assemblyOption in assembly ~= { _.copy(includeBin = false) }
```

To make a jar containing only the dependencies, type

    > assemblyPackageDependency

NOTE: If you use [`-jar` option for `java`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/java.html#jar), it will ignore `-cp`, so if you have multiple jars you have to use `-cp` and pass the main class: `java -cp "jar1.jar:jar2.jar" Main`

### Content hash

You can also append SHA-1 fingerprint to the assembly file name, this may help you to determine whether it has changed and, for example, if it's necessary to deploy the dependencies,

```scala
assemblyOption in packageDependency ~= { _.copy(appendContentHash = true) }
```

### Caching

By default for performance reasons, the result of unzipping any dependency jars to disk is cached from run-to-run. This feature can be disabled by setting:

```scala
assemblyOption in assembly ~= { _.copy(cacheUnzip = false) }
```

In addition the fat JAR is cached so its timestamp changes only when the input changes. This feature requires checking the SHA-1 hash of all *.class files, and the hash of all dependency *.jar files. If there are a large number of class files, this could take a long time, although with hashing of jar files, rather than their contents, the speed has recently been [improved](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly/issues/68). This feature can be disabled by setting:

```scala
assemblyOption in assembly ~= { _.copy(cacheOutput = false) }
```

### Publishing

If you wish to publish your assembled artifact along with the `publish` task
and all of the other artifacts, you can add an `assembly` classifier (or other):

```scala
artifact in (Compile, assembly) ~= { art =>
  art.copy(`classifier` = Some("assembly"))
}

addArtifact(artifact in (Compile, assembly), assembly)
```
